# Knowledge Base Conventions

This section outlines the standards and best practices for maintaining a coherent and navigable knowledge base.

## Naming Conventions
- **Directories (Abstractions)**: Use clear, descriptive names.
- **Files (Atoms)**: Name files to reflect their content succinctly.
- **Metadata Files**: Append \`.meta.md\` to associate metadata with corresponding content.

## Structural Guidelines
- Separate content from metadata to ensure clarity.
- Use index files as entry points for directories.
- Maintain consistent Markdown formatting for readability.

## Versioning and Updates
- Document changes and updates in metadata.
- Follow semantic versioning principles for major updates.
