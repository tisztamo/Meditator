  Project name: StreamOfConsciousness

  It is an AI agent that maintains a state in the form of a knowledge base - a
  directory structure of markdown and metadata files, and continuously executes
  streaming calls to LLMs , generating a stream of consciousness. When an
  external event happen (e.g. in the form of an incoming prompt from a user, a
  web api call or as a result of a tool call, or simply after some timeout), the
  consciousness stops and a pipeline of a few non-streamed call to an LLM
  decides which prompt use next as the source of consciousness. The stream is
  printed on the console or to a websocket. There is a webapp too to serve the
  stream and receive inputs.
