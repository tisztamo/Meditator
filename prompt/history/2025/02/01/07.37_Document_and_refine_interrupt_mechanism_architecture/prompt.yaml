  Refine the interrupt mechanism.


  Internal interrupt generators are separate tasks that run according to a
  schedule (e.g. after every generated token, in every 10 seconds). They can
  also use LLMs to understand the recent stream, they can also access the main
  knowledge base and they have their own state in a separate, private knowledge
  base.

  An interrupt - either internal or external - is a markdown document describing
  datetime, the interrupt source/type, last tokens of the output stream,
  interrupt reason and any other info relevant to the interrupt.


  Think deeply and refine thoughtfully!
