  Rewrite the knowledge base documentation. The current one is just the first
  sketch, we need more thought and refinement. The current one is also
  inconsistent, need to fix.

  - Directories (and subdirs) are "Abstractions"

  - Normal markdown files contain "Atoms"

  - Find good definitions for Atom and Abstraction!

  - We call Atoms and Abstraction together: Topics

  - index.md is present in every dir, it contains a one-liner title, a one
  paragraph description and links to the main topics in this abstraction (either
  subdirs (sub-abstractions) or files (atoms) in this dir). The text of the link
  is a short one-liner about the linked topic and its relation to this parent
  abstraction.

  - We do not need metadata.md.

  - Every atom can have its own metadata. atom1.md is the atom itself,
  atom1.meta.md is contains the metadata

  - index.meta.md contains the abstraction's metadata
