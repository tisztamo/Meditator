  - External and internal interrupts are handled the same way

  - Remove "System Events" from External Interrupt Sources. Currently only the
  three "user inputs" are external sources. Also don't call them user inputs,
  just external sources.

  - Custom Generators are not a third type besides token- and time- based ones,
  because custom ones can be any of them. They are a separate thing.
